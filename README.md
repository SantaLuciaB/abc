A well known video on-demand service provider has contacted the University  to request an
improvement to its Resume Playback feature. Users would like to be able to stop playback and resume it
later on, to keep on watching their movies or series where they left them. With this goal in mind, we are
asked to develop a software application that allows us to consult the list of programs that have been recently
played and the instant of the program in which it stopped playing.
Create a Java project called prPlatform, and the classes Program, Favorites and FavoriteGenres that
will be included in a package called platform. In addition,  the class TestNitflex.java .
